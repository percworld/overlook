### Motel Ubuntu lies in the Mountains of South Africa, where there is a heritage of hospitality and an instinct for a generosity.

#### This app is designed to keep a hotel bookkeeping record and assist the customer in choosing and booking rooms while maintaining an account.  #### The users, hotel rooms, and bookings are hosted on a server and accessible through API calls.

#### Navigation of the app:
1. Login using the credentials listed below.


3. Search for a room based on your preference and for the date you would like to stay
