### Motel Ubuntu lies in the roots of South Africa, where there is a heritage of hospitality and an instinct for a generosity.

#### This app is designed to keep a hotel bookkeeping record and assist the customer in choosing and booking rooms while maintaining an account.  #### The users, hotel rooms, and bookings are hosted on a server and accessible through API calls.

#### Navigation of the app:

1. Login using the credentials listed below.
2. You will see your status level as someone who has invested in the company. Your last stay is visible on the right.
4. Search for a room based on your preference and for the date you would like to stay
5. Choose which room you would like and your account will update.  This is now stored on the server and cannot be overbooked.
6. If you would like to see your current bookings, the hovering see bookings button will shpw all past and future bookings.
